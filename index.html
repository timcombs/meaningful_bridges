                <p>
                  Maybe you feel unable to move away from a bad situation - a rift in a relationship, crushing anxiety, grief, the effects of trauma. Maybe you are in a transition - changing jobs, leaving the military, moving, beginning or ending a relationship, realizing you&rsquo;ve left your youth behind - and feel lost or stressed due to the change. Perhaps you are stuck in behaviors that don&rsquo;t serve you and want relief from the anxiety and shame. I&rsquo;ll listen without judgment to your stories that say where you came from, where you are, and where you are going.

                  Sometimes it is difficult to say what needs to be said, to get both the discomfort and joy in your stories into the open. I will be here to provide a space free of shame and stigma to help you be heard and to help you hear yourself. I'm drawn to helping those struggling with anxiety, childhood trauma, grief, or life transitions create the life they want.

                We find what we need to survive the challenges of life. Often what was once helpful becomes harmful.

                Under the law, all health care providers need to give clients who don’t have insurance or who are not using insurance an estimate of the expected charges for medical services, including psychotherapy services.
              </p>
              <p class="service-description">
                You have the right to receive a Good Faith Estimate for the total expected cost of any non-emergency healthcare services, including psychotherapy services. You can ask your health care provider, and any other provider you choose, for a Good Faith Estimate before you schedule a service, or at any time during treatment.
              </p>
              <p class="service-description">
                If you receive a bill that is at least $400 more than your Good Faith Estimate, you can dispute the bill. Make sure to save a copy or picture of your Good Faith Estimate.

          <p>
            If you are unable to keep an appointment, a 24-hour cancellation notice is required or you will be charged your full session fee. This is necessary because a time commitment is made to hold your session time exclusively for you. If you are late for a session, you may lose some of that session time.

          <h3 class="service-title">Confidentiality of Communications</h3>
          <p>
            I use HIPAA-compliant Gmail for email communications, Google Voice for text messages, voicemail, and phone-based therapy sessions. Video sessions are hosted through a secure client portal. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Note that although I use a HIPAA-compliant email service, confidentiality can&rsquo;t be 100% guaranteed with this form of communication.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Occasionally, I may need to consult with other professionals in order to provide the best treatment for you. Information about you may be shared in this consultation context without using your name or other identifying information.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="service-title">Contact Between Sessions</h3>
          <p>
            If you need to contact me between sessions, you can send an email or text, or call and leave a voicemail. I am often not immediately available; however, I will do my best to get back to you within 24 hours. 
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="service-title">If You Are In Crisis</h3>
