                  A little about me...
                </p>
                <p>
                  I moved to Portland in the 90's and embraced a hybrid career surfacing the needs of others through community organizing, nonprofit work, teaching, and participating in the arts. Listening to and advocating for people was the way I was able to show up for my community and myself, a middle-aged, multiracial, male-presenting queer who navigates my own childhood trauma, neurodivergence, and chronic pain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The connection I make with people in the counseling room is powerful. I provide space for clients to share their stories, their worlds, their feelings, taking opportunities to engage in deep contact so I can help them explore what feels vulnerable and important on their journey of discovery and growth.

                  I know that everyone has the ability to overcome adversity, recover from trauma, build resilience, and learn to thrive in their life. Building a relationship with a therapist who provides a safe, non-judgmental space can help.

                <p>
                 I have experience doing trauma-informed, co-occurring work with couples, mature & senior adults, veterans, BIPOC folks, men, clients who aren’t sure what counseling is, and the family and friends that support them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I've worked with couples and individuals impacted by anxiety, grief, life transitions, ADHD, childhood trauma & PTSD, and addictions (substance, internet, gambling, crypto), and a general sense of being stuck.

                  Therapy is a process of uncovering the emotional depth of your concerns and how they affect your life holistically. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Exploring your stories will help us focus on your relationships, community, meaningful ways of being, values, and strengths that will help you make changes you want to make.

                  Words are not the only way to convey story.

                  Often what once worked to get us through our days starts working against us.

          <p>
            If you are unable to keep an appointment, a 24-hour cancellation notice is required or you will be charged your full session fee. This is necessary because a time commitment is made to hold your session time exclusively for you. If you are late for a session, you may lose some of that session time.
          </p>

          <h3 class="service-title">Confidentiality of Communications</h3>
          <p>
            I use HIPAA-compliant Gmail for email communications, Google Voice for text messages, voicemail, and phone-based therapy sessions. Video sessions are hosted through a secure client portal. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Note that although I use a HIPAA-compliant email service, confidentiality can&rsquo;t be 100% guaranteed with this form of communication.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Occasionally, I may need to consult with other professionals in order to provide the best treatment for you. Information about you may be shared in this consultation context without using your name or other identifying information.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="service-title">Contact Between Sessions</h3>
          <p>
            If you need to contact me between sessions, you can send an email or text, or call and leave a voicemail. I am often not immediately available; however, I will do my best to get back to you within 24 hours. 
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="service-title">If You Are In Crisis</h3>

            I do not provide 24-hour crisis services. If you are having a mental health emergency, call 988, go to your nearest hospital emergency room, or utilize one of the resources below.
